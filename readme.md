### :eyeglasses: for tech nerds like me 
#### the technologies that the game runs on :
##### front end:
<ul>
<li>Pure html and css</li>
<li>Some parts of the game use ReactJS</li>
<li>Pure vanilla javascript for the server rendering</li>
</ul>

##### backend
<ul>
<li>Nodejs/express as a web server</li>
<li>Socket.io to handle web sockets</li>
<li>Mongodb/mongoose as database</li>
<li>Typescript to add strong types to vanilla javascript</li>
</ul>

#### almost all the game is written in typescript/javascript for both the backend and front end

#### what will i add in the future:
<ul>
<li>implement house rules</li>
<li>add realistic mode with limited number of cards which also will limit number of players in single game</li>
<li>add challenge for the standard rules</li>
<li>add the ability to save the game</li>
</ul>
